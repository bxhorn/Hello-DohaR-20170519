# Hello-DohaR-20170519

Here are the revised discussion slides in PDF format.  Key changes include:
  - New links to answer the question "Which map projection is best?"
  - A new slide on map visualizations: basic insights plus links on how to interface R maps with Java tools for web delivery
  - Corrections to content errors found during the meeting
  - Updated R code syntax highlighting to better reflect standard code highlights in RStudio

I also included here the R code for the "case study." Download the R script files and the zip file with supporting data.  Completing the case study exercise is simple and straightforward:
- Unzip and store the data files in you preferred directory
- Source Configure.R
- Update CaseStudy.R with your preferred data path location 
- Source CaseStudy.R

It was a pleasure to meet you.  Feel free to stay in touch.  Collaboration in R is always welcome.
