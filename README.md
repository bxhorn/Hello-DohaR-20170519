# Hello-DohaR-20170519

Here are the revised discussion slides in PDF format from our meeting yesterday.  Key changes include:
  - New links to answer the question "Which map projection is best?"
  - A new slide on map visualizations: basic insights with links on how to interface R with Java tools for web delivery
  - Corrections to content erros found during the meeting
  - Updated all R code syntax highlighting to better reflect standard code highlights in RStudio

I also included here the R code for the "case study." Download the R script files and the zip file with supporting data.  To complete the case study is exercise is simple and straightforward:
- Unzip and store in you preferred directory
- Source Configure.R
- Update CaseStudy.R with your data path location and source the file

A good day to you!
