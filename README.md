# Hello-DohaR-20170519

Here is the material I presented at our Doha R meeting.

Given the broad input of others, Ive revised the discussion slides in PDF format.  Key changes include:
  - Corrections to errors on slides found during the meeting
  - New examples and links to answer the question "Which map projection is best?"
  - Links to answer questions on "How to interface R maps with Java tools for web delivery?"
  - Updated R code and syntax highlighting to better reflect standard code highlights in RStudio

I also include here the R code for the "case study." Download the R script files and the zip file with supporting data.  Completing the case study exercise is simple and straightforward:
- Unzip and store the data files in you preferred directory
- Source Configure.R to ensure a consistent workspace environment across machines for repeatable results
- Update CaseStudy.R with your preferred data path locations 
- Source CaseStudy.R 

It was a pleasure to meet you all and I thank you for your helpful input and questions.  Collaboration in R is always welcome.
