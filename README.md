# Hello-DohaR-20170519

Here are the revised discussion slides from our meeting yesterday.  Key changes include:
  - New links to answer the question "Which map projection is best?"
  - A new slide on map visualizations: basic insights and links for R interfaces to Java mapping tools / web delivery
  - Corrections to any content erros found during the meeting
  - Updated all R code syntax highlighting to better reflect standard code highlights in RStudio

I also included here the R code for the "case study" exercise with supportng data and map layers.
